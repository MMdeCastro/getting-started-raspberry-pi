## Setting up Python

To get started, you will need to have Python, pip and  Jupyter Notebook installed.

To set up your Python environment, follow the instructions in repository: [getting-started-with-python](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-with-python/blob/master/README.md)


## Exploring Temperature and Humidity Data

In the [data-exploration](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-raspberry-pi/blob/master/analysis/data-exploration.ipynb) exercise, you create and visualize time series data.
 
You also examine some important characteristics of time series such as seasonality and trend  ad conclude by about learning commons tools for time series analysis.
 
## Making Univariate Predictions with Temperature Data

In these exercises you will experiment with different approaches to making univariate time series with predictions.

Before you build use complex techniques for univariate time series prediction, traditional approaches should also be implemented as a baseline. The [predictions-with-sarima](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-raspberry-pi/blob/master/analysis/prediction-with-sarima.ipynb) you  focus on building a SARIMA Model and different ways to select SARIMA hyperparameters.

In the [predictions-with-neural-network](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-raspberry-pi/blob/master/analysis/predict-with-nn.ipynb) exercise, you will set up a basic neural network and experiment with options for training the best model.


## Making Multivariate Predictions

The [prediction-season](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-raspberry-pi/blob/master/analysis/predict-season.ipynb) exercise - for fun - you use both temperature and humidy to predict the season of the year.
