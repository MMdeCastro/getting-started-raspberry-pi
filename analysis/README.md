## Setting up Python

To get started, you will need to have Python, pip and  Jupyter Notebook installed.

To set up your Python environment, follow the instructions in repository: [getting-started-with-python](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-with-python/blob/master/README.md)


## Exploring Temperature and Humidity Data

In the [data-exploration](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-raspberry-pi/blob/master/analysis/data-exploration.ipynb) exercise, you create and visualize time series data.
 
You also examine some important characteristics of time series such as seasonality and trend  ad conclude by about learning commons tools for time series analysis.
 
## Making Univariate Predictions with Temperature Data

The [prediction-times-series-data](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-raspberry-pi/blob/master/analysis/prediction-times-series-data.ipynb) exercise starts with an overview of basic approaches for making univariate time series with predictions.

Before you build use complex techniques for univariate time series prediction, traditional approaches should also be implemented as a baseline.


You will learn about the common univariate approaches and focus on building a SARIMA Model and different ways to select SARIMA hyperparameters.

## Multivariate Predictions

The [prediction-season](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-raspberry-pi/blob/master/analysis/predict-season.ipynb) exercise - for fun - you use both temperature and humidy to predict the season of the year.
