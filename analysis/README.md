## Setting up Python

To get started, you will need to have Python, pip and  Jupyter Notebook installed.

To set up your Python environment, follow the instructions in repository: [getting-started-with-python](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-with-python/blob/master/README.md)


## Exploring Temperature and Humidity Data

In the [data-exploration](https://github.com/pyladieshamburg/getting-started-raspberry-pi/blob/master/analysis/data-exploration.ipynb) exercise, you create and visualize time series data.
 
You also examine some important characteristics of time series such as seasonality and trend 
    
Conclude by learning commons tools for time series analysis
 
## Making Predictions with Temperature Data

This exercise starts with an overview of basic approaches for making univariate time series with predictions.

You will learn about the SARIMA Model and different ways to select SARIMA hyperparameters.
